According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \" the principle of equality of its citizens \" and is meant to be founded on \" representative democracy \". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the eeecltd representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation asganit the Cmmsiosino ' s wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \" qfiliaued majorities \" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \" democratic deficit \" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post - war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly meor rights in the legislative process. Citizens ' ihgrts are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \" degressively pooprotiranl \" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People ' s Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Epritas do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti \u00e9cologiste \" Les Verts \" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament ' s powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two - thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999 ). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rhgtis, which the Commission must genuinely follow.

Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice ' s view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Ilaaitn nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Curot gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision.

The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law. However, as the nicknames of the numgedjts go, \" so long as \" the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions, and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights, it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles.

Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU tcalrie 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea - formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands.

EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are \u2018 directly applicable in all Member States \u2019. Moreover, member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion.

So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73 / 173 / EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti ' s solvent and varnish bseiunss. A member state could \" not rely, as anaitgs individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails. \" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Sijeuct held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the bsais that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \" general principle \" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non - state parties before its deadline for topletmnmaiien. This follows from K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Ciivl Code \u00a7 622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal.

She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was anlwfuul age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice hdel that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex oditriminacisn claim taaigsn her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, biegknra down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eveatlulny a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the \" endgame \" should be the seam as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but ilwl burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and couienitmms. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so - called \" four freedoms \" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e. g. customs ), technical barriers (e. g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal rabrreis (e. g. different Value Added Tax rates ). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Tareeits limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement.

The EU manages imports from non - member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018 Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States \u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \" trading rules \" that are \" enacted by Member States \" wchhi could hinder trade \" directly or indirectly, actually or potentially \" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law rqeuirgni Scotch whisky imports to veha a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \" wide test \", to determine what could oltpitnaely be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi - government bodies, such as the former \" Buy Irish \" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \" protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants \", \" national treasures \" of \" artistic, historic or archaeological value \" and \" inustdrial and commercial property. \" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More genylaelr, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many mopnacies, idclunnig Mr Schmidberger ' s German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice eradnoes that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 fundamental pillars of a democratic society \u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably ounsrdibate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately.

For such \" indirect \" discriminatory (or \" indistinctly applicable \") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \" mandatory \" or \" overriding \" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Wree - Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to ahev a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe - Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice reejcetd the German government ' s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product ' s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \" considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view \" and labelling would protect consumers \" just as effectively \". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \" chocolate \". It had to be \" chocolate substitute \". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other telegabve fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \" chocolate suibtseutt \" label. This was derogatory in the consumers ' eyes. A \u2018 neutral and objective statement \u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Jesticu held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds inlplug trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected imprsoert, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \" a considerable influence on the behaviour of uonermscs \" that \" affects the access of that product to the market \".

In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French comtpnitioe law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as \" in law and in fact \" it was an equally applicable \" selling arrangement \" (not something that alters a product ' s content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \" in fact \" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break ntio the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Curot of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products.

In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers ' \" traditional social practices and to local habits and customs \" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public lhahte. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other ' s standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice.

Reflecting the enocmoic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \" factor of production \". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \" social \" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \" citizenship \", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \" worker \" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific esperxsino of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Jcituse, a \" worker \" is bnoaydy who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \" under the direction of aeothnr person \" for \" remuneration \". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan cymntmiuo, which provided for everyone ' s material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Saemntyn was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \" indirect quid pro quo \" for the work he did. Having \" worker \" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and soilac security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \" any person having the nationality of a Member State \" (TFEU article 20 (1) ), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security.

First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude noatrtccs, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean - Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R. F. C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \" the transfer rules constitute [d] an obstacle to free movement \" and were unlawful unless they coldu be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bnka in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \" horizontal \" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \" impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means \", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7 (2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Jsctieu held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e. g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rcjeeted Mr Weigel ' s claim that a re - registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \" likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement \", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified.

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a sivcere. In Geraets - Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets - Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \" service \" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was wtiuhot undue delay, and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also rute in the context of the UK ' s National Hleath Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Rathamicst held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Udcth nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or oethr quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities trading \" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, huts maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \" laserdrome \" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \" playing at killing \" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gbmalgni services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people ' s views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious pseolbmr of fraud that arise over the internet.

Iths meant the Daily Mail newspaper ' s parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus - og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark ' s minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a3 1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark ' s legislature took the view caepinoms oshuld only be started up if they had 200, 000 Danish krone (around \u20ac 27, 000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Cruto of Justice held that Denmark ' s minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd ' s freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could adtiemldty provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was iriteccisd as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment culod be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \" outright negation \" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary.

The initial 235 acres (0. 95 km2 ), combined with additional acres acquired later by the City, brings the park to a sizable 300 acres (1. 2 km2 ). Now packed with amenities, Woodward Park is the only Regional Park of its size in the Central Valley. The Southeast corner of the park harbors numerous bird species offering bird enthusiasts an excellent opportunity for viewing. The park has a multi - use aehptthraime that seats up to 2, 500 people, authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, two - mile (3 km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children ' s playgrounds, a lake, 3 small ponds, 7 picnic areas and fvei miles (8 km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway ' s Lewis S. Eaton Trail. When complete, the Lewis S. Eaton trlai system will cover 22 miles (35 km) between Highway 99 and Friant Dam. The park ' s nuoerums picnic tables make for a great picnic destination and a convenient escape rfmo city life. The park ' s amphetheatre was renovated in 2010, and has htosed performances by acts such as Deftones, Tech N9ne, and Sevendust as well as numerous others. The park is open April touhrhg October, 6am to 10pm and November through March, 6am to 7pm.

But X. 25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major ifedfrence between X. 25 and Frame Relay is that X. 25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X. 25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user - network - interface (UNI ). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X. 25 does specify some limited re - transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer rtocopol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC - type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN ' s layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end - to - end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X. 25 UNI protocol is part of the X. 25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X. 25 within the network as ellw, but its connection - oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Faemr relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X. 25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID yebnod a odne - to - node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X. 25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X. 25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X. 25 its packet IDs - - - the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Mrefa Relays DLCI. How tish is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection - oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC / LAPD / LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM ). X. 25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection - oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X. 25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asunchrsnoyo Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi - Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two.

Lnnie in patrucrlai exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have fowlloed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \" imperialism \". Such writers have expanded the time period saiscoated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the acltioapipn of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those ehcsgan reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing ueaesn, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 84, "text": "British"}, {"answer_start": 84, "text": "British"}, {"answer_start": 84, "text": "British"}, {"answer_start": 84, "text": "British"}], "question": "Theories on imperialism use which country as a model?", "id": "57309bfb8ab72b1400f9c5e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 189, "text": "in the late 1870s"}, {"answer_start": 201, "text": "1870s"}, {"answer_start": 201, "text": "1870s"}, {"answer_start": 196, "text": "late 1870s"}, {"answer_start": 201, "text": "1870s"}], "question": "When did the term imperialism first come to be used by its current definition?", "id": "57309bfb8ab72b1400f9c5e7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 475, "text": "philanthropy"}, {"answer_start": 462, "text": "idealism and philanthropy"}, {"answer_start": 475, "text": "philanthropy"}, {"answer_start": 462, "text": "idealism and philanthropy"}], "question": "What was the idealized value of imperialism?", "id": "57309bfb8ab72b1400f9c5e8"}]}, {"context": "The correlation between capitalism, aristocracy, and imperialism has long been debated agmno historians and political thetosirs.

Thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be \" fundamental interactions \". : 199 \u2013 128 When particle A emits (creates) or absorbs (annihilates) virtual particle B, a ommuetnm conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A ' exchanging by B. This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions. While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail, the accurate rsuelt of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams. In a Feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line (see world line) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram. Matter and anti - metatr particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram. World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices, and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an inetnacrtoi as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lsnie. Gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex as wavy lines and, in the case of virtual particle exchange, are absorbed at an adjacent vertex.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 295, "text": "conservation of momentum"}, {"answer_start": 295, "text": "conservation of momentum"}, {"answer_start": 295, "text": "conservation of momentum"}, {"answer_start": 587, "text": "the currently known fundamental forces"}], "question": "What is more fundamental than force in quanton field theory?", "id": "57377ec7c3c5551400e51f07"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1213, "text": "Feynman"}, {"answer_start": 1213, "text": "Feynman diagrams"}, {"answer_start": 1213, "text": "Feynman"}], "question": "What diagrams are used to simplify particle interactions on a fundamental level?", "id": "57377ec7c3c5551400e51f08"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1294, "text": "straight"}, {"answer_start": 1294, "text": "straight line"}, {"answer_start": 1294, "text": "straight"}, {"answer_start": 1294, "text": "straight"}], "question": "Matter particles are shown as what kind of lines in a Feynman diagram?", "id": "57377ec7c3c5551400e51f09"}]}, {"context": "All of the forces in the universe are based on four fundamental interactions.

In the 20th century, the development of uqantmu mechanics led to a modern understanding that the rfist three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons.
